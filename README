scripts.git
===========

This repository containes miscellaneous scrips that I use or have used
previously.

Patches are welcome.

Unless otherwise noted, assume these scripts are available under the GPL-2
license.

radio.pl
========
http://ossowicki.com/?p=116
http://ossowicki.com/?p=159

Named 'radio' here. I use this script for playing internet radio stations.
It reads the list of stations from a YAML document. A standard list of
stations is supplied in the 'radiostations'-file. Supports scrobbling to
Last.fm if the stream contains useful track information. Uses mplayer to do
the actual playback. See the above URLs for more information.

crcheck
=======
I got tired of running the crc32-script on every file in my incoming folder,
comparing the results and creating ed2k hashes afterwards, if they matched.
crcheck does this, provided the crc32 and ed2k_hash executables are installed
(take a look at your package mangler… on gentoo it’s dev-perl/Archive-Zip for
crc32 and net-p2p/ed2k_hash for that one).
Run as: crcheck [-q] path [path ...]
-q disables ed2k-hashing (speeds up the process if you don’t need them anyway).

flac2m4a & ogg2m4a
==================
These scripts do what they say. Convert flac and ogg-files to the AAC/m4a
format, preserving tags. I use these for converting music for my ipod.
They use the nero aac decoder, encoder and tagger available here:

twit
====
A simple command-line twitter-client using perl's Net:Twitter module. I wrote
this for use with my twitter-widget for the awesome window manager. See
http://ossowicki.com/?p=171 for details

fix_nipponsei
=============
I like the Nipponsei group, and their releases of unlicensed anime OSTs a lot.
I don’t, however, like their naming scheme. This is a small script, that will
read the MP3-tags of a file, and rename it to suit them. The new format goes
something like ‘Artist – Anime [Album] – Track’ and either Artist or Album can
be overridden from the CLI. Note: I don't actually use this any longer. I prefer
the Musicbrainz tagger client Picard.

battery
=======
A small perlscript that parses the output of
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/{info,state} and calculates remaining battery capacity
and expected remaining time.
